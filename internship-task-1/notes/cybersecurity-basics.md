Cybersecurity Basics-

A. Understanding the CIA Triad: 
The CIA Triad is the foundation of information security, consisting of three key principles:
1. Confidentiality 
   - Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized users.  
   - Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.  
   - Example:Using encryption to protect passwords.
2. Integrity
   - Ensures that data is accurate and has not been modified.  
   - Protects against unauthorized modification or corruption.  
   - Example:Using digital signatures to verify any files or important docs.
3. Availability 
   - Ensures that information and systems are accessible when needed.  
   - Protects against various attacks.  
   - Example:A hospital’s patient database must be online 24/7 so doctors can access patient records anytime.
     
B. Exploring Threat Types:
1. Phishing
   - Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information (like passwords) by disguising as a trustworthy entity.  
   - Example: Fake emails from bank asking for credentials.
2. Malware  
   - Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.  
   - Example:Viruses, worms, and spyware.
3. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)  
   - Attack where multiple systems overwhelm a target system with traffic, making it unavailable.  
   - Example: Botnets flooding a website with requests.
4. SQL Injection 
   - Attack targeting web applications by injecting malicious SQL queries to access or manipulate databases.  
   - Example:Logging into a website without credentials.
5. Brute Force Attack
   - Attempting all possible combinations to guess passwords or encryption keys.  
   - Example:Automated tools trying thousands of passwords to access an account.
6. Ransomware
   - Malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands payment for decryption.  
   - Example:WannaCry (2017) — It infected thousands of computers worldwide, encrypted users’ files, and demanded payment in Bitcoin to unlock them.
     
C. Various Attack Vectors
1. Social Engineering  
   - Manipulating people into revealing confidential information.  
   - Example:Phone calls pretending to be IT support asking for passwords.
2. Wireless Attacks
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks.  
   - Example:Access points or keys.
3. Insider Threats 
   - Threats originating from within the organization.  
   - Can be intentional (malicious employee) or accidental.  
   - Example:Employee leaking sensitive files.

Conclusion:
Understanding the CIA Triad, threat types, and attack vectors is important in the field of cybersecurity. This knowledge helps in designing secure systems, detecting attacks, and mitigating risk
