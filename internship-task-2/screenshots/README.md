  - Screenshot: Shows whether target host(Metasploitable2 VM) is alive and responding. 0% packet loss.
- 7. Banner Grabbing – FTP- (banner_grabbing.png)
  - Command-
     - nc -v 192.168.56.101 21
     - nc → Netcat (network utility for reading/writing to network connections).

  - Screenshot: Service type and version of SSH server.SSH banner successfully grabbed from Metasploitable2. 

STEP 4- Packet Analysis with Wireshark
 - 1.Capture HTTP, FTP, DNS traffic.
   - IN Command Prompt: cd C:\Users......\testfile
   - py -3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0
   - O/P Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...192.168.56.102 - -
   - ScreenShot:  
 - 2.Filter credentials from unencrypted FTP traffic.
   
 - 3.Analyze SYN flood attack (simulate with hping3).
